TryRuby:
- Multi-line statements usually have a blank line at the top 
  and it makes the scroll bar appear
- STDOUT needs to be redirected to the console
- Tutorial needs to be better
- UI needs to be cleaned up

Overall:
- For HTML-only apps, need a default loading indicator
  (like the loading indicator that gmail has)
